AUTHORSHIP
This projects includes code in Matlab to simulate digital communication systems. The code was mostly generated by I. Santos and J.J. Murillo Fuentes. 

GOAL OF THE PROJECT
This Project includes codes in Matlab to perform iterative detection and decoding, using LDPC, for equalisation and MIMO detection. In particular, it generates the code used in the papers, including the figures:

The Project is useful to anyone dealing with equalization, MIMO and channel detection and, specially, those trying to compare to our methods.

Please, if you use this code cite some of these references in your work.


GET STARTED
To use the code download the files. You will find three folders whose name start with "Simulations". Each folder correspond to the simulation contained in the three citations above:

- SimulationsMIMO to citation 1
- SimulationsKSEP to citation 2
- SumulationsDEPeq to citation 3

The folder ParityCheckMatrix contains some LDPC parity matrices used.

The rest of the files and the folder algorithmsCode are the core of the project and are used by the three cases in the three folders aforementioned.

You will need the communications toolbox by Matlab. Also, we use the tikz toolbox to generate tex files, by this is not needed for the simulations and pdf figures can be generated in any case.

In any of the three folders above you will find some .m files along with some folders. Any of these .m files corresponds to a simulation. This files call to a initialisation file, in folder confiFiles, that configures the whole simulation. Then calls to the main core functions in the main (upper) folder.  Results are saved on ResultsXXXX. Once terminated, you can use the .m functions in the plots folder to get the figure, that will be placed in the folder figuresXXXX

We hope you will find creating your simulation easy enough. You may pick the most similar simulation to your scenario and then change parameters.
